- All included third-party components remain under their original licenses.

## Removed Components (as of v0.2.2)

In earlier experimental stages, a placeholder for a `dbt_project/` folder and related configuration variables existed.  
These artefacts have been removed as of version **0.2.2**.  
elevata is now fully independent of dbt or any other external transformation runtime.

## Additional Components

Future features of elevata may integrate further third-party libraries.
