## [Unreleased]

### ðŸ§© *Work in Progress & Upcoming Enhancements*

#### Overview  
This section lists features and improvements currently under active development.

---

## ðŸ§­ Roadmap  

### Next Milestone (0.3.x Roadmap Teaser)

- Automated generation of `TargetDataset` and `TargetColumn` structures  
  derived from imported metadata (including PK propagation and surrogate key creation)  
- Surrogate key hashing with runtime-loaded pepper for DSGVO compliance  
- Target references and automatic join generation for data lineage  
- Flat-file and REST source adapters  
- Extended metadata profiling and statistics  
- Enhanced governance and access control

### Planned Mid-term
- Automated generation of **dbt models** based on stored metadata
- Gradual decoupling from **dbt** â€” elevata remains compatible, but offers a native rendering and execution engine for full independence
- **Ingestion** of relational databases and other sources
- Built-in **core transformations** and data-engineering **best practices**
- Environment-aware **metadata validation** (Dev/Test/Prod consistency checks)  

### Planned Long-term  
- Support for additional data platforms  
  *(Microsoft Fabric, Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks, SQL Server)*  
- Declarative deployment of **target objects** to physical schemas  
- Extended **security and governance layer** (dataset-level access policies)  
- Optional REST / GraphQL API for external metadata integration

ðŸ§¾ Licensed under the **AGPL-v3** â€” free to use, extend, and share.  
ðŸ’¡ *elevata keeps evolving â€” one small, meaningful release at a time.*

---
## [0.2.0] - 2025-10-XX

### ðŸ§© *Metadata Introspection & Profiles Integration*

#### Overview  
This release marks a major milestone - **elevata** now connects to relational sources via **SQLAlchemy** and imports full schema metadata directly into its core models. The new profile and secret management architecture 
lays the foundation for secure, declarative, and environment-aware metadata operations.

---

#### ðŸš€ Highlights  

- **Generic Metadata Import via SQLAlchemy**  
  - Engine factory supporting multiple relational backends (MSSQL, Postgres, SQLite).  
  - Reads column definitions, data types, PK information from `SourceDataset` entries.  
  - Automatic datatype normalization across dialects (e.g. `NVARCHAR` â†’ STRING, `BIT` â†’ BOOLEAN).  

- **Flexible Secrets & Profiles**  
  - Unified `elevata_profiles.yaml` config with environment-based secret resolution.  
  - Connection references derived convention-based from `type` and `short_name`.  
  - Optional Azure Key Vault integration.  

- **Security & Configuration**  
  - Sensitive data never stored in the database.  
  - Secrets resolved dynamically at runtime via `.env` or Key Vault.  
  - Clear separation of metadata and operational configuration.  

- **Developer Experience**  
  - Simplified connector interfaces and improved error reporting.  
  - Cleaner model relationships for `SourceSystem` and `SourceDataset`.  
  - New code organization: `connectors.py`, `resolver.py`, `ref_builder.py`.

---

#### ðŸ§­ Next: v0.3.0 will focus on automated target model generation and metadata lineage.

---

#### ðŸ§  Technical Notes  

- Fully decoupled from dbt profiles; all runtime connections and secrets resolved through `elevata_profiles.yaml`.  
- All SQL renderers return expressions as plain text templates â€” ready for downstream ELT tools or custom runners.  
- Surrogate Key hashing implemented engine-specifically (Postgres pgcrypto / MSSQL HASHBYTES).  
- Supports per-profile Overrides for multi-DB systems (e.g. `sap1`, `sap2` â†’ `sap`).  
- Improved ordering, idempotency and error reporting in import and generation routines.

### ðŸª¶ *UI Polish & PostgreSQL Power*

#### Overview  
A refinement release that makes **elevata** smoother and more flexible:  
a polished Django UI meets full **PostgreSQL** support â€” available via Docker or your own setup.  
Better visuals, faster workflows, and real database choice.

---

#### âœ¨ Improvements  

- **UI & UX Enhancements**  
  - Polished Django interface with cleaner layouts and spacing  
  - Improved responsiveness and overall visual consistency  
  - Optimized inline interactions and usability tweaks  

- **Database Support**  
  - Full PostgreSQL backend support  
  - Works with Docker Compose or a user-provided instance  
  - Updated settings for seamless configuration and migrations  

- **Developer Experience**  
  - Simplified environment setup (SQLite or PostgreSQL)  
  - Improved local testing through Docker Compose

## [0.1.0] - 2025-10-14

### ðŸ§© *Metadata Management Comes Alive*

#### Overview  
This release marks a major milestone:  
**elevata** now provides a fully functional, metadata-driven web interface for managing your data platformâ€™s core structures â€” built with **Django**, **HTMX**, and a clean **Bootstrap 5** theme.  

Itâ€™s the first end-to-end usable version:  
from user login â†’ to inline editing â†’ to audit tracking â€” all running securely and responsively out of the box.

---

#### ðŸš€ Highlights  

- **Complete Metadata Management Module**  
  - Inline CRUD with audit fields and user tracking  
  - Automatic URL & view generation for all models  

- **Modern UI & UX**  
  - Responsive elevata theme (Bootstrap 5.3)  
  - Autofocus & usability improvements for inline editing  
  - Unified form and grid styling  

- **Security & Reliability**  
  - Integrated authentication (login, logout, password change)  
  - Safe CSRF handling for all HTMX requests  

- **Developer Experience**  
  - Default SQLite backend for easy setup  
  - Clean folder structure: `core/`, `metadata/`, `dbt_project/`  
  - Ready for future extensions (PostgreSQL, dbt, etc.)
