# 🧭 elevata Documentation Index

Welcome to the **elevata Labs Documentation Hub** —  
your single source of truth for metadata-driven data & analytics automation.

This index gives you an overview of all major topics and how they fit together.

## 🗺️ Table of Contents

### 🚀 Getting Started

- [Getting Started](getting_started.md)  
  Install elevata, run the first migration, and open the UI.

- [Secure Metadata Connectivity](secure_metadata_connectivity.md)  
  Configure profiles, environment variables, secrets, peppers and secure access to source/target systems.

---

### 🧩 Metadata Model & Generation

- [Generation Logic](generation_logic.md)  
  How metadata is transformed into Logical Plans and final SQL.  
  Includes dataset types (RAW, STAGE, CORE, …), dependencies and generation rules.

- [Incremental Load Architecture](incremental_load.md)  
  Incremental patterns, MERGE semantics, deletion handling, and how elevata models change propagation.  

- [Load SQL Architecture](load_sql_architecture.md)  
  How elevata transforms lineage and metadata into executable SQL through the logical plan,  
  renderer, and dialect adapters — covering full loads, merge operations, and delete detection.  

- [Historization Architecture](historization_architecture.md)  
  Complete SCD Type 2 historization model: versioning, change detection, deletion,  
  surrogate keys, lineage-based attribute mapping, and SQL generation.  

- [Schema Evolution](schema_evolution.md)  
  Schema evolution is metadata-driven, deterministic, and lineage-safe.  
  Structural changes are never inferred implicitly from SQL but are always derived  
  from explicit metadata changes.

---

### 🎨 SQL Rendering & Dialects

- [SQL Rendering Conventions](sql_rendering_conventions.md)  
  General rules for how SQL is formatted and rendered (identifiers, literals, ordering, readability).

- [Dialect System](dialect_system.md)  
  Overview of the dialect abstraction, the dialect registry, and how BigQuery, Databricks, DuckDB, Fabric Warehouse, MSSQL, Postgres and Snowflake are implemented.

- [Target Backends](target_backends.md)  
  Which engines are supported and how they fit into a Lakehouse or Warehouse architecture.

---

### ▶️ Execution & Observability

- [Load Execution & Orchestration Architecture](load_execution_architecture.md)  
  How elevata executes load plans: dependency graphs, retries, failure semantics, load run logging and execution snapshots.

---

### 💡 Concepts

- [Architecture Overview](architecture_overview.md)  
  High-level view of elevata’s architecture: metadata, lineage, Logical Plan, rendering and execution.

- [Query Builder & Query Tree](query_builder_and_query_tree.md)  
  Conceptual introduction to elevata’s Query Builder and Query Tree.  
  Explains *why* custom query logic exists, *when* it should be used,  
  and *how* it integrates with metadata-driven generation.

- [Determinism & Execution Semantics](determinism_and_execution_semantics.md)  
  Rules and guarantees for deterministic SQL generation,  
  including ORDER BY requirements, window functions, aggregation semantics  
  and error vs warning classification.

- [Lineage Model & Logical Plan](logical_plan.md)  
  How datasets depend on each other, how lineage is represented, and how the Logical Plan encodes queries.

- [Expression DSL & AST](expression_dsl_and_ast.md)  
  The vendor-neutral expression DSL (Domain Specific Language) (HASH256, CONCAT_WS, COALESCE, COL, …), the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree), and how dialects render it.

- [Hashing Architecture](hashing_architecture.md)  
  Surrogate key and foreign key hashing: deterministic rules, cross-dialect SHA-256, null handling and pepper strategy.

- [SQL Preview & Rendering Pipeline](sql_preview_pipeline.md)  
  How the UI builds previews from metadata, Logical Plan and dialect selection (HTMX-based).

- [Bizcore — Business Semantics Layer](bizcore.md)  
  Bizcore is elevata’s dedicated layer for modeling business meaning  
  and rules as first-class metadata — without introducing a BI semantic layer.

- [Metadata Health Check](health_check.md)  
  Built-in checks for incomplete or inconsistent metadata, and how to interpret them.

---

### 🌐 Source Integration

- [Source Backends](source_backends.md)  
  Overview of supported source systems and how to configure them (JDBC/ODBC, file-based, etc.).

---

### ✅ Testing & Quality

- [Test Setup & Guidelines](tests.md)  
  How the core test suite is structured, how to add tests for new features, and how to reason about coverage.

---

## ♟️ Strategy & Architecture

- [elevata Platform Strategy](strategy/elevata_platform_strategy.md)  
  Conceptual overview of elevata’s metadata-native execution and business semantics.

---

### 📦 Project

- [Main Project README](readme_ref.md)  
  The top-level README from the Git repository (architecture, goals, roadmap).

- [Changelog](changelog_ref.md)  
  Release history

---

## 🧭 Where to start?

If you are new to elevata, a good reading path is:

1. [Getting Started](getting_started.md)  
2. [Architecture Overview](architecture_overview.md)  
3. [Generation Logic](generation_logic.md)  
4. [Dialect System](dialect_system.md)  
5. [Hashing Architecture](hashing_architecture.md)  

This will give you a mental model for how metadata flows through the platform and becomes executable SQL.

---

## 🧭 Advanced Reading Path: Semantic Modeling & Query Logic

If you want to understand how elevata models advanced business logic  
while remaining metadata-native and deterministic, continue with:

1. [Bizcore — Business Semantics Layer](bizcore.md)  
2. [Query Builder & Query Tree](query_builder_and_query_tree.md)  
3. [Determinism & Execution Semantics](determinism_and_execution_semantics.md)  
4. [Lineage Model & Logical Plan](logical_plan.md)  
5. [SQL Preview & Rendering Pipeline](sql_preview_pipeline.md)
