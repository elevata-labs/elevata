## What is elevata?

elevata is a framework for metadata-driven data platform development.  
The goal is to let teams design and operate data platforms with minimal effort â€“ powered by:  

- **Ingestion** â€“ simplified, parameter-driven data loading  
- **Transformation** â€“ built on dbt, with metadata at the core  
- **Orchestration support** â€“ helper files for integration with common orchestrators,  
  fully **lineage-driven from source to target**

Itâ€™s still early days â€“ but the direction is clear:  
**metadata in â†’ best practices out.**
